  ## Completed modifications to the html and css files of the provided "Horiseon" website home page
  
# Description

  ## By examining html elements and the corresponding css style sheet, I was able organize and consolidate both files so that the webpage displays properly while reducing the amount of code to a level that is both efficient and easy to follow. Additionally, I cross referenced any changes with the use of Google developement tools. Finally, small alterations were made to the site's appearance for the sake of consistency (i.e. Footer text and background was made to match header)
